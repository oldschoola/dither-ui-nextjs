# DOX framework

- DOX is highly performant AGENTS.md hierarchy installed here
- Agent must follow DOX instructions across any edits

## Core Contract

- AGENTS.md files are binding work contracts for their subtrees
- Work products, source materials, instructions, records, assets, and durable docs must stay understandable from the nearest applicable AGENTS.md plus every parent AGENTS.md above it

## Read Before Editing

1. Read the root AGENTS.md
2. Identify every file or folder you expect to touch
3. Walk from the repository root to each target path
4. Read every AGENTS.md found along each route
5. If a parent AGENTS.md lists a child AGENTS.md whose scope contains the path, read that child and continue from there
6. Use the nearest AGENTS.md as the local contract and parent docs for repo-wide rules
7. If docs conflict, the closer doc controls local work details, but no child doc may weaken DOX

Do not rely on memory. Re-read the applicable DOX chain in the current session before editing.

## Update After Editing

Every meaningful change requires a DOX pass before the task is done.

Update the closest owning AGENTS.md when a change affects:

- purpose, scope, ownership, or responsibilities
- durable structure, contracts, workflows, or operating rules
- required inputs, outputs, permissions, constraints, side effects, or artifacts
- user preferences about behavior, communication, process, organization, or quality
- AGENTS.md creation, deletion, move, rename, or index contents

Update parent docs when parent-level structure, ownership, workflow, or child index changes. Update child docs when parent changes alter local rules. Remove stale or contradictory text immediately. Small edits that do not change behavior or contracts may leave docs unchanged, but the DOX pass still must happen.

## Hierarchy

- Root AGENTS.md is the DOX rail: project-wide instructions, global preferences, durable workflow rules, and the top-level Child DOX Index
- Child AGENTS.md files own domain-specific instructions and their own Child DOX Index
- Each parent explains what its direct children cover and what stays owned by the parent
- The closer a doc is to the work, the more specific and practical it must be

## Child Doc Shape

- Create a child AGENTS.md when a folder becomes a durable boundary with its own purpose, rules, responsibilities, workflow, materials, or quality standards
- Work Guidance must reflect the current standards of the project or user instructions; if there are no specific standards or instructions yet, leave it empty
- Verification must reflect an existing check; if no verification framework exists yet, leave it empty and update it when one exists

Default section order:
- Purpose
- Ownership
- Local Contracts
- Work Guidance
- Verification
- Child DOX Index

## Style

- Keep docs concise, current, and operational
- Document stable contracts, not diary entries
- Put broad rules in parent docs and concrete details in child docs
- Prefer direct bullets with explicit names
- Do not duplicate rules across many files unless each scope needs a local version
- Delete stale notes instead of explaining history
- Trim obvious statements, repeated rules, misplaced detail, and warnings for risks that no longer exist

## Closeout

1. Re-check changed paths against the DOX chain
2. Update nearest owning docs and any affected parents or children
3. Refresh every affected Child DOX Index
4. Remove stale or contradictory text
5. Run existing verification when relevant
6. Report any docs intentionally left unchanged and why

## Project Facts

- dither-ui: a dithered UI toolkit for Vue (dither-ui.com). Two halves:
  `dither-kit/` (the portable component library) and `src/` (site + studio).
  `dither-next/` is an in-progress Next.js/React port (engine ported; components
  and app pages follow) — it does not touch the Vue app.
- Stack: Vue 3, TypeScript strict, Vite, Tailwind v4, d3-scale/d3-shape.
  No vue-router; Vitest covers models/components; no emojis in code.
  `dither-next/` uses Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript strict,
  Tailwind v4 — see `dither-next/AGENTS.md`.
- Aliases: `@` → `src/`, `@dither-kit` → `dither-kit/` (vite.config.ts +
  tsconfig paths — change both together). `dither-next/` mirrors these
  aliases in its own `tsconfig.json`.
- Canonical routes: `/` landing · `/docs[/section]` · `/studio`; legacy hash
  routes remain supported for old links. GitHub Pages deploys through
  `.github/workflows/pages.yml`; default deploy base is `/` because
  `public/CNAME` sets `dither-ui.com`. Set repo variable
  `VITE_BASE_PATH=/dither-ui/` only when removing the custom domain and using
  the GitHub Pages project URL.
- Assets: `public/faces.webp` is the measured portrait/emote band;
  `public/sprites.webp` is the broader character sheet.

## Workflow Rules

- Verification gate before any commit: `npx vue-tsc --noEmit` and
  `npx vite build` green; visual/stateful changes also checked in a live
  browser (vite preview + screenshots).
- Multiple agents may work this tree concurrently. Stage and commit only the
  files you changed; never revert another agent's uncommitted work — if it
  blocks the build, save a patch first and coordinate.
- Commit at the end of every completed task; concise message naming the seam.
- Fix root causes, not symptoms; no TODOs, stubs, or placeholder logic.
- `.rpiv/` contains private local research/workflow artifacts: keep it ignored,
  excluded from container contexts, and out of public commits.

## User Preferences

- Design direction: dark, monospace, pixel/dither identity; Japanese-minimal
  restraint (one statement / one action / one visual) on the landing.
- Docs follow shadcn-style anatomy (sidebar rail, Preview/Code tabs, API
  tables, variant galleries) while keeping the dither skin.
- Prefer editing existing code over adding new files; avoid over-abstraction and
  new dependencies. Net-negative LOC is prized when behavior remains complete.
- Accessibility is a floor, not a feature: labels, focus rings, reduced-motion
  and reduced-transparency support are expected in every change.
- `dither-kit/AGENTS.md` — the toolkit: dither engine, palette, component
  contracts, portability rules
- `src/AGENTS.md` — the app: FSD layers, routing, editor/history/persistence
  contracts, a11y floor
  - `src/pages/AGENTS.md` — landing/docs/studio page conventions
- `dither-next/AGENTS.md` — the Next.js/React port: scaffold + engine
  (framework-agnostic TS ported verbatim, Vue reactivity → React contexts/hooks)

## BACKLOG WORKFLOW INSTRUCTIONS

This project uses Backlog.md MCP for all task and project management activities.

**CRITICAL GUIDANCE**

- If your client supports MCP resources, read `backlog://workflow/overview` to understand when and how to use Backlog for this project.
- If your client only supports tools or the above request fails, call `backlog.get_backlog_instructions()` to load the tool-oriented overview. Use the `instruction` selector when you need `task-creation`, `task-execution`, or `task-finalization`.

- **First time working here?** Read the overview resource IMMEDIATELY to learn the workflow
- **Already familiar?** You should have the overview cached ("## Backlog.md Overview (MCP)")
- **When to read it**: BEFORE creating tasks, or when you're unsure whether to track work

These guides cover:
- Decision framework for when to create tasks
- Search-first workflow to avoid duplicates
- Links to detailed guides for task creation, execution, and finalization
- MCP tools reference

You MUST read the overview resource to understand the complete workflow. The information is NOT summarized here.
