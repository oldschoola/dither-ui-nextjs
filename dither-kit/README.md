# dither-ui

Dithered UI toolkit for Vue 3 — composable ordered-dither **charts** (area,
line, bar, pie, radar) on one tiny canvas engine, plus generative **avatars**,
**buttons**, **gradient washes** and friends.

This package ships **source** (`.ts` + `.vue`), like shadcn-style kits: your
bundler compiles it with your app. Requirements:

- Vite (or any bundler) with `@vitejs/plugin-vue`
- Tailwind CSS for the chrome classes (`text-muted-foreground`, `stroke-border`, …)
  with shadcn-style tokens (`--foreground`, `--card`, `--border`, `--popover`)

```ts
import { AreaChart, Area, Grid, XAxis, YAxis, Legend, Tooltip } from "dither-ui"
```

```vue
<div class="h-80">
  <AreaChart :data="data" :config="config" bloom="low">
    <Grid />
    <XAxis dataKey="month" />
    <YAxis />
    <Area dataKey="desktop" is-clickable />
    <Legend is-clickable />
    <Tooltip labelKey="month" />
  </AreaChart>
</div>
```

Every visual knob is a prop: colors accept palette names, hue numbers or hex;
`variant` accepts presets or a full texture config; `bloom` accepts presets or
`{ blur, brightness, opacity, saturate }`; `easing` accepts presets or
cubic-bezier points.

## Server precompilation

`renderDitherGradient()` and `renderDitherButton()` are dependency-free
server-safe compilers. They return `{ width, height, data }` RGBA buffers that
can be encoded by the host application with PNG/WebP tooling such as `sharp`:

```ts
const raster = renderDitherGradient({ width: 960, height: 600, cell: 2, seed: 42 })
const png = await sharp(Buffer.from(raster.data), {
  raw: { width: raster.width, height: raster.height, channels: 4 },
}).png().toBuffer()
```

Pass the resulting public URL as `precompiled` to a chart root or standalone
surface. The kit currently exports compilers for gradient and button rasters;
chart, image, and spinner precompiled URLs are consumed by the kit but generated,
encoded, cached, and invalidated by the host app. The chart image replaces the
dither canvas while its SVG and DOM children remain available. Use
`renderMode="static"` when a client paint is needed but animation and resize
observation are unnecessary.

## Client cost controls

`cell` controls backing resolution; larger cells mean fewer pixels to compute.
The kit also pauses chart RAF loops while invisible, batches standalone surface
pixels through one `putImageData`, and copies bloom layers only after a changed
frame. Keep `animate`, `sparkles`, and bloom off for static content, and use the
precompiled path for content whose data and dimensions are known on the server.

The repository benchmark is available at `/benchmarks/`; it records six measured
batches after three warmups and reports mean, median, p95, canvas-call count, and
RGBA allocation count. It covers the large gradient `fillRect` → `putImageData`
path and button fresh-buffer versus reused-buffer rendering. See the root README
for the current local baseline and reproduction command.
